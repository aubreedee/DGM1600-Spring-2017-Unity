Notes on Scope and Access Modifiers

Scope:
The scope is from the opening brace to the closing brace of any statement, class, function etc. 

Access Modifiers:
It deals with the access to a variable by determining if access is public, private, local or globaly.
From the C# pocket book the definition for Access Modifiers is:
    "...a type or type member may limit its accessibility to other types and other assemblies by adding
        one of five access modifiers to the declaration:
        
        public:
            Fully accessible. This is the implicit accessibility for members of an enum or interface.
        internal:
            Accessible only within the containing assembly or friend assemblies. This is the default
            accessiblilty for non-nested types.
        private:
            Accessible only within the containing type. This sis the default accessibility for members 
            of a class or struct.
        protected:
            Accessibile only within the containing type or subclasses.
        protected internal:
            the union of protected and internal accessibility (this is more permissive than protected
            or internal alone, in that it makes a member more accessible in two ways)."

I kind of look at access modifiers the way we have our personal computer set up. The "Admin Login" which
has access to all the programs/files (public or globaly), and then the personal logins which has access to
only certain programs and files. Also files created on the personal account are only accessible from that 
account.
